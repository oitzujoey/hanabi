There are two functions that this program performs. The first is to interpret Hanabi. The second is to compile Hanabi. There is obviously overlap here. I suspect that the parser will remain the same. Hanabi is unique in that compilation will always call the interpreter for preprocessing. I think that because of this there should only be one executable. Compilation will call the interpreter and then the compiler, while the interpreter will call the interpreter twice.
We now have two meanings of the word "interpreter". :| Let's call the main program the interpreter because that's what laymen will call it. If you care that much about the distinction between the two terms, then the sub-interpreter will be called the ... subinterpreter!
